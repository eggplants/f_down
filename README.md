# How to use
This enables you to download picture and .html data of [futabachannel](https://www.2chan.net/) via [tsumanne.net](tsumanne.net).
This work on terminal.
You can choose directory where save the files. Please change "/tool/save_dir.txt".
###### Motive
["tsumanne.net"](tsumanne.net) is a site which is always logging a part of "[futabachannel](https://www.2chan.net/)" threads to create thread logs and retrieve pictures. (Other log sites aren't logging full-sized pictures.)
But, unfortunately, some logs are removed automatically because of unpopularity. So, before removed, I wanna download these ones.
