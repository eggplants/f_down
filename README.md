This enables you to download picture and log data from [tsumanne.net](tsumanne.net).
# TODO
- Download by...
  - some indexes
  - thread urls
  - a number of files of which the thread contains.
  - file size
  - post date
  - and more...
- create mht files with retrieved datas
- GUI
###### Motive
["tsumanne.net"](tsumanne.net) is a site which is always logging a part of "[futabachannel](https://www.2chan.net/)" threads to create thread logs and retrieve pictures. (Other log sites aren't logging full-sized pictures.)
But, unfortunately, some logs are removed automatically because of unpopularity. So, before removed, I wanna download these ones.
# Notice
- This app is making and my first app... So, please be kind for me...
